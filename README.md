# AWS Serverless Data Processing & Storage Workflow 
Built a Cloud-Based User Registration System Using AWS! ☁️
Deployed a user registration webpage on EC2, mapped with a custom domain via Route 53.
 User enters name and email, which are sent through API Gateway to an AWS Lambda function.
 Lambda processes the data and stores it in a MySQL database on Amazon RDS.
 The entire flow is monitored with CloudWatch for real-time logging and diagnostics.
This project demonstrates my practical experience in designing and deploying scalable, serverless solutions using core AWS services.
 🔧 Tools Used: EC2, Route 53, API Gateway, Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch
